```{r}
wilt$classlabel = factor(wilt$class, levels=c('n', 'w'), labels=c(0,1))
wilt.3x = glm(classlabel ~ Mean_NIR + Mean_Green, family=binomial(link="logit"), data=wilt)

display(wilt.3, digits=4)

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
